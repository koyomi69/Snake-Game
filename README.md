# Snake-Game
A Multiplayer Snake Game created in Python using Sockets

HOW TO RUN THESE FILES?

First of all, run the Server.py file. It takes 3 arguments: IP Address, Port NO, Number of Players

Next, we have to run the Snake.py file which takes 2 arguments: IP Address, Port NO

For example:

python Server.py 127.0.0.1 8000 2

# First Client

python Client.py 127.0.0.1 8000

# Second Client

python Client.py 127.0.0.1 8000

NOTE: The IP and Port of the Clients must be the same as the Server
